# Blinkit-Clone
This project is a replica of the Blinkit e-commerce website, built with HTML and CSS. It features a user-friendly interface with a navigation header and interactive modals for location detection, login prompts, and cart information. Users can explore products through clickable images and a manual carousel, all designed for a clean and efficient shopping experience.
